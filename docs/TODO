TODO STUFF FROM NEUROPHYRE:

Fix ttys appearing in wholist, and (related?) "The BBS is down, but you
will be let in" originating in shell.c which lets a user in when the BBS
is down if they appear to be on a tty (?).

Figure out command line options (main.c and _netbbs/_clientbbs) where
necessary, especially -b (the backup option).  _netbbs and _clientbbs
are internal, -q is to start the queue, -u is to update the <@>-list
and whoknowsroom files.

Figure out config files etc/limits etc/lockout.

Fix voting booth.

Check 'user is not online' when attempting to X Guest

Investigate if bad to remove "Empty message -- message not entered"
checking in doc_msgs.c

?) Figure out the #ifdef linux stuff in defs.h

Consider removing or disabling code to preserve old Xes across
sessions - probably better to make this an option for users to pick,
based on the opinions they've expressed

Write compile docs, autoconf, shell scripts??

Remove hardcoded paths etc from ssl_server.c ?  (fixed?)

Remove gethostbyname from ssl_server.c to prevent connection delay on
hosts that this times out on if possible.

Attempt to make sitebanning code use netmasks and IPs only if it
doesn't.  Figure it out first.  (for now, a firewall script is in use)

Help files:

The following are missing (?) help files which haven't been investigated:

? doc.c:      help("yell.voice.1", NO);
? doc.c:      help("yell.voice.2", NO);
? doc.c:      help("yell.voice.3", NO);
? doc.c:      help("yell.voice.4", NO);
xmsg.c:        help("oldexpressopt", NO);
system.c:    help("new.disallow", NO);
system.c:    help("new.restricted", NO);
system.c:       help("new.namesame", NO);
system.c:    help("new.restrictedbye", NO);

This may not be all the source files they're in, so grep on the filenames.



TODO STUFF GRANDFATHERED IN FROM THE PARENT VERSION:

Relogging in will cause errno # 11 in sem_unlock.  ?
SILC
OVERRIDE
Re-check new account creation
Make username change to use same number.
Would be nice to have a <r>eadall and/or e<x>press all command that reads
*all* data.
