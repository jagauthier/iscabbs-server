Create etc/down in your BBS dir to deny access if you're kicking people
off for maintenance or something (may not work if your wholist is showing
TTYs for most users -- see TODO)

There is a hack in doc.c that allows new users to post in rooms with
roomnumber of 4 or lower (excluding lobby).  grep for 'newuseraccess'
in doc.c, it's right around there.  Due to text in the newuseraccess
help file, room 4 should be Tech Support>.  room 0 is lobby, 1 is
mail, 2 and 3 should be Aide (yells pasted) and Sysop (copies of yell
correspondence, etc) respectively.

-Just an empty file, or specific format?

-Wow, dude.  maxusers = max users before queued, lockoutflag = similar to
-/etc/down's functionality?

For SSL server:
edit Makefile lib paths, and uncomment SSLINC, SSLLIB with paths, anad
comment out SSLLIB without paths.  result:
SSLINC= -I/home/bbs/include
SSLLIB= -L/home/bbs/lib -lssl -lcrypto
#SSLLIB=-lssl -lcrypto
Remove -lsocket from ssl_server: in Makefile
edit hardcoded BBSPath in ssl_server.c to reflect location of
dedicated (read: -D_SSL compiled) bbs binary, or use -f to override on
command line

I think -- though I have not tested this -- "bbs -b" does something backup-
-related.
If you're getting a repeated error and respawning every 15 seconds, I think
you need to grep the source for "errno != 11" or similar and change the 11 to
EAGAIN.

On solaris, set semsys:seminfo_semmnu=100 in /etc/system seems to control
number of possible users.
