vDOC 1.7 (a variant of DOC Version 1.7, Fbrd rev. 0.3) is currently not
released under the GPL or similar license.  If I understand correctly,
the version of DOC which Firebird modified WAS GPL'ed, but since he did
not officially release his modified code, the GPL does not apply to this
branch.  You may read the messages at the bottom of this file and decide
for yourself about the state of the code at this time.

That being said:

vDOC is NOT distributed with ANY WARRANTY, express or implied, even an
implicit warranty or guarantee of fitness for a particular purpose.
By compiling or using vDOC, you agree to hold any and all authors,
programmers, or redistributors of vDOC harmless from any and all damages
that may be caused, whether directly or incidentally, by the compilation,
use, abuse, or malfunction of vDOC, or any software or other products
which incorporate code or other parts from vDOC in any form.

Hey, did you release JayDOC under any sort of license (say GPL or similar).

I never released it.  Never got to clean it up.

Sorry to pepper your mailbox with questions, but can you clear up a licensing
question?  A party who wishes to remain nameless was looking at the source from
my-client.isbroken.com (recently updated, I might add, and still available to
anyone) and was concerned that with no license info included, it falls under
default copyright and it would be a violation to modify/redistribute it.  And
you -did- say before that you hadn't released the code...  but it didn't seem
like you minded that it's being redistributed and potentially modified.  And
obviously Ivor doesn't care since he's putting it up.  But could you clarify
your position once and for all?

It's okay to redistribute it and remodify it and what not, but it should be
clear that:
The code is based on DOC 1.7 (or whatever the version number is) and
it has been modified to give its current features to Fbrd 0.3 (that was my
final version number before I quit) and then whatever version number you may
give to it, say Neuro 1.8.
Take a look at the Eschwa login screen how it says Doc 1.7, Fbrd 0.3.  That's
all you need, and it would be nice if that were available to the public, either
via the hello message or by the old ABC command of <c>onfig, <v>ersion.  I
can't remember if I put that in here or not.  Now, let me go back and re-read
the other mails and make some sense out of them. :)
